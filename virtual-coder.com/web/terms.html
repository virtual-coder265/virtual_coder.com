                    <h3>3.1. Making Payment</h3>
                    <p class="mb-5">Upon successful registration, you will be requested to deposit an
                        amount equivalent to your chosen plan. Payment methods may vary
                        depending on your Course and location. For local scholars, accepted payment methods
                        are Airtel Money, Tnm Mpamba, Standard Bank, and National Bank. For
                        international scholars, payments are made through Paypal and Gpay. To
                        ensure safe and secure payments, the following measures should strictly
                        be adhered to:<p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                  All payments should be triggered and authorized by the user through
                                  his/her third party service of choice. The payment account details are emailed to you via the email address you provided during registration.
                                </li>
                                <li>We request a proof of payment after successful payment transaction</li>
                                <li>
                                    We strongly recommend you to keep proof of payment (e.g. screenshot of the payment confirmation page) for future reference.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  We do not process any auto-renewal. Therefore, to renew your
                                  subscription plan, you will have to initiate and process the payment
                                  once ready.
                                </li>

                                  <strong>DO NOT</strong> share any of your payment information (e.g.
                                  credit card number, SSN, account details, or pin) with us, unless
                                  stated otherwise.
