      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p>
        Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using our
        services.
      </p>
      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal
        information. All data collected from our users is securely stored and
        never shared with any third-party, unless required by law. We will only
        use your information to provide you with our services and to improve
        your experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using our services, you agree to our Privacy Policy and understand
        that we may occasionally send you promotional messages related to our
        services.
      </p>
      <h2>Payment and Subscription Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Upon successful registration, you will be requested to deposit an
        amount equivalent to your chosen plan. Payment methods may vary
        depending on your location. For local scholars, accepted payment methods
        are Airtel Money, Tnm Mpamba, Standard Bank, and National Bank. For
        international scholars, payments are made through Paypal and Gpay. To
        ensure safe and secure payments, the following measures should strictly
        be adhered to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All payments should be triggered and authorized by the user through
          his/her third party service of choice.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not process any auto-renewal. Therefore, to renew your
          subscription plan, you will have to initiate and process the payment
          once ready.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DO NOT</strong> share any of your payment information (e.g.
          credit card number, SSN, account details, or pin) with us, unless
          stated otherwise.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on our services. If you are not
        satisfied with our services within 30 days of your purchase, you can
        request a refund by contacting us at support@ourcompany.com. We will
